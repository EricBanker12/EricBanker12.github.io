            <h1>About Steganography</h1>
            <p>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">Steganography</a> is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within
            another file, message, image, or video."</p>
            <p>This website uses HTML5 and Javascript to take an image and hide some text inside it. Computers display color by pixels, and each pixel has a 
            color value for red, green, and blue ranging from 0 to 255. Internally, these numbers are stored in binary computer memory as 00000000 to 11111111.
            Because a color value 240 (11110000) looks similar to 255 (11111111), we can delete then hide information in the lower half of each binary number.</p>
            <p>This site lets you hide or unhide text converted to an image inside another image.</p>
