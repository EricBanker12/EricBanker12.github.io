"Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video."

This website uses HTML5 and Javascript to take an image and hide some text inside it. Computers display color by pixels, and each pixel has a color value for red, green, and blue ranging from 0 to 255. Internally, these numbers are stored in binary computer memory as 00000000 to 11111111. Because a color value 240 (11110000) looks similar to 255 (11111111), we can delete then hide information in the lower half of each binary number.

This site lets you hide or unhide text converted to an image inside another image.
